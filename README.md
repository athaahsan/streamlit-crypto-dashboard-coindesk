This project is a cryptocurrency dashboard that visualizes real-time market data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis using public APIs.  
It combines market visualization with an AI-powered technical insight system to provide structured analysis based on quantitative signals.

## Features

### 📊 Live Price Data
Displays cryptocurrency prices using the [CoinDesk Index API](https://developers.coindesk.com/documentation/data-api/index_cc), specifically based on the **CADLI** market.  
More about CADLI can be found [here](https://indices.coindesk.com/cadli).

### 📈 Chart Visualization
- Candlestick, Line, and OHLC chart types
- Toggleable indicators available in the interface:
  - Volume (VOL)
  - Moving Average (MA)
  - Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- Configurable chart range and interval selection

### 😱 Market Sentiment
Integrates the [Fear and Greed Index API](https://api.alternative.me/fng) to provide an overview of current crypto market sentiment.

### ✨ AI Insights (Daily Interval Only)
An AI-powered technical analysis module generates structured trading bias based on internally engineered indicators.

These indicators are **not displayed on the chart**, but are calculated in the background as part of the AI payload:

- RSI(14) momentum signals
- MACD(12-26-9) histogram trend
- ADX(14) trend strength
- Directional Index (+DI / −DI) dominance
- EMA alignment and price distance
- Fear & Greed sentiment data

The AI produces probabilistic signals:
- `buy_confidence`
- `hold_confidence`
- `sell_confidence`

Analysis is strictly based on provided technical data without external market assumptions.
